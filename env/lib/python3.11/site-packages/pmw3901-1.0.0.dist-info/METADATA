# Installing

Stable library from PyPi:

* Just run `python3 -m pip install pmw3901`

Latest/development library from GitHub:

* `git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/pmw3901-python`
* `cd pmw3901-python`
* `./install.sh`

# Usage

The PAA5100JE has a slightly different init routine to the PMW3901, you should use the class provided to ensure it's set up correctly:

```
from pmw3901 import PAA5100
```

And for the PMW3901, continue using the old class:

```
from pmw3901 import PMW3901
```

The example `motion.py` demonstrates setting up either sensor, and accepts a `--board` argument to specify which you'd like to use.

1.0.0
-----

* Port to gpiod/gpiodevice
* Repackage to hatch/pyproject.toml
* BREAKING: spi_cs_gpio will not auto-detect SPI CS line, use spi_cs=(0, 1)
* BREAKING: Constants `BG_CS_FRONT_BCM` and `BG_CS_BACK_BCM` are now CS lines, not pins

0.1.0
-----

* Add init support for PAA5100JE
* Add frame capture support

0.0.1
-----

* Initial Release
